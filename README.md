My name is Reid Harrington, I am a second year computer science student at Laurier University. 
This is a personal project I have been working on in my spare time. It takes a text document filled with a list of movies, and a python script converts the movies into movie objects. 
This website displays the python movie objects as sleek looking cards, and uses a movie database API to get the posters.
